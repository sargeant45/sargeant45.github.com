## EssayMaker update!
This is a kind of unnecessary, but I was just going to talk about EssayMaker and the science documents that go with it.

**If you aren't familiar with science fairs,** anything including humans for testing must have a document explaining certain things about the project that concern humans. I am having 30 students write an essay with my program, which seems harmless but still includes *humans.* I wrote that today.

Also, I wrote the work in progress research packet that is needed to get a grade on the project.

***So in recap,*** I'm about ready to test EssayMaker in humans! This will be great. I'll keep you posted and stuff.

Look at my [papers](https://gist.github.com/sargeant45/fb87325c3bcbeedc3def) if you are interested.
