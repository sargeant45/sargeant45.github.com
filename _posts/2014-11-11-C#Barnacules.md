One of my favorite people On YouTube is Barnacles Nerdgasm. He's a great dude and loves to help out with charity. He 3D prints, unboxes, and is just flat out amazing.

**He also does C# tutorials.** Now, C# is a pretty good beginner programming language, and is very similar to JavaScript, the language of the Web. So, as the programming tip of the day, go check out Barnacules' Codegasm videos. Here is a link to the first episode on the playlist:
