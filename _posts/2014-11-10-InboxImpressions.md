I recently recieved an invite to Inbox, the new app for Gmail "by Gmail".
At first glance, this is what you may see:

So Inbox is basically the "new" Gmail app. The best way to describe it is every email app that has showed up as important on the App Store. It's Boxer, Mailbox, and others all smashed up into one mail app. And it's cool. Inbox allows you to create Google now card-like "bundles" for emails that do just that: Bundle things together.

**For instance,** say I want all of my Twitter notification emails in a bundle inside my Inbox. Well, I set it up so all of the emails coming from Twitter are automatically put inside that bundle.

That's just a taster, so I'll see you again when I have used Inbox for a while with the full review.
