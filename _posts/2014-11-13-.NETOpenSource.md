**I can't describe how pumped I am right now. The .NET framework all of the C#/C++** devs love is now open source along with ASP.NET.
<hr>

***Now this means a few things.*** 

1, .NET framework is now editable by any developer who wants to chip in, and it may have some dedicated Mac and Linux ports in the future along with ASP.NET for Linux and Mac, and 2, Microsoft finally has a Github page for .NET, found [here.](https://github.com/dotnet)

***But seriously,*** .NET IS OPEN SOURCE. Good move, Microsoft.

Also, if you are an open source dev or want to get into open source development, [Visual Studio Community](http://www.visualstudio.com/products/free-developer-offers-vs?wt.mc_id=Unsassigned_GOO_USEvergreenSearch_Unassigned&WT.srch=1&CR_CC=Unassigned) is for you.
