title: "Why Video Games Are Totally Amazing"
---

Video games. Most parents hate them, but children and teenagers adore them. They are made to challenge you, or relax you, addict you, or pass through you. They just are. I said something today that may or may not be true in the long run: "Video games excite me enough that I don't think I'll ever do drugs." I really don't, while playing mobile games, you have the chance to play them throughout the day and get that rush. That good feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. It's great! Now the downside of this is the latter: addiction with video games and/or drugs. What I'm saying is full addiction to video games. I mean, some games are even designed to be addictive, like *Candy Crush* and *Clash of Clans*, making you wait to keep playing after you hit the point where you might get bored, feeding on the addiction.

But either way, video games can be a force for good: events like [Games Done Quick](https://gamesdonequick.com/), an event where gamers speedrun games to finishing to raise money for charity. Sites like [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/), where you buy games for what you want and give money to charity.

Games are awesome.

You've gotta admit.
