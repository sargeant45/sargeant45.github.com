title: Calzy/Stacks/Pick Review(s)
---

I'm a nerd. I like numbers, I like charts, I like money, I like tracking everything.
The 3 apps by [WapleStuff](http://waplestuff.com/) are some I've been using a lot. I take Algebra in school, and it requires a lot of calculation. For this reason, [Calzy](http://www.calzy.waplestuff.com/) is awesome. It is clean and uncomplicated, and does everything I need it to do.

I'm going to review these one at a time.

Let's review it.

## [Calzy](http://www.calzy.waplestuff.com/) review
Calzy is an amazing calculator app for the iPhone/iPad and iPod touch.

Let's go over the features:
- Clean interface.
- Dark and light themes.
- Money calculation.
- Bookmark and keep a history of calculations.
- Reorder expressions.

**Now the way I think I will review these features is through usefullness/how well they work.**

#### Clean Interface
This is a winner. The interface is super clean, and works well. I do wish the button presses had more tactile feedback.

Take windows buttons for example, they have a simple but prominent animation that happens when you click.

That's really my only gripe.

#### Dark and Light Themes
They pretty much explain themselves. The dark theme is awesome and so is the light theme. They look pleasing to the eyes and are awesome. You can also change the theme accent color, which is awesome for people with iPhone 5C's like myself.

#### Money Calculation
Money calculation is something I found myself using almost all of the time. I like its automatic rounding and decimal cutting, and it is really useful for Algebra problems involving money. It works really well.

#### Bookmark/History
This is where I get a little bit less happy with the usefulness of a feature. I think that "bookmarking" is really... not very useful. I have never used it. Ever. Heck, I don't even know how to bookmark. I think Calzy would be a lot smarter if WapleStuff junked this and added custom functions. Like, say I want to have two numbers put in and then get the percent X is of Y. Right? It would be so smart and useful. And it would all be user made, so all of the requests that get sent in would be possible on purchase.

#### Reorder Expressions
I've used this before, but it isn't very useful for me and I can't give that much feedback on it. With longer equations it is a lifesaver; but I've never had something that long so I can't really give smart thoughts on it.

## Verdict
[Calzy](http://calzy.waplestuff.com/) is a clean, useable calculator but still has a long way to go. With a clean and simple interface, it is well on its track.
