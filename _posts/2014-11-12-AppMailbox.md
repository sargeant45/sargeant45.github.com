## Mailbox by Dropbox

**Mailbox** has had a long history of almost 2 years now. *Within weeks,* the app was bought out by cloud giant Dropbox. The whole point of Mailbox was to stay organized, and keep your inbox empty when it was done with. You archived emails by swiping and getting rid of them when they didn't matter.

Mailbox is an app built on swipes and keeping your inbox tidy. I was skeptical at first, but it totally won me over. When Mailbox first came out, there was a waiting list. I jumped on the opportunity while I was on vacation and annoyed my parents because I would not stop blabbing about being on the list and wanting to "get in." It was like this hip thing and it was- an email app?

Mailbox is really great, and it will definitely help you get away from the Mail app on your iPhone or Android device or the dreaded Gmail app on iPhone (it's *okay* on Android) and will bring you into organization.

It's easy. And free:

P.S.: this was made in part because I am testing Inbox and as a goodbye to my favorite mail app, Mailbox.
