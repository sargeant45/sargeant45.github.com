## CriticalResponseMaker

### A 7th grade lifesaver. [Complete]

I'm in 7th grade and one of the projects we do every week is the Weekly Challenge. This really doesn't apply to any other people but if you are a teacher and want to use this then cool, shoot me an email and I'd love to give it to you.

Here are the links:

## TheGame

### This game isn't really a game, but a box. [Complete]

This "project" is really just a test. I wanted to see how much I could do in C# with the internet's knowledge only. This was the unlikely result.
